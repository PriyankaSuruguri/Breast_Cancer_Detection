# Breast Tumor Detection with Deep Learning
## Overview
This project focuses on Breast Tumor Detection using deep learning models, with a focus on mammogram images. The objective is to develop a model capable of accurately classifying mammograms into benign and malignant tumor categories, helping in the early detection of breast cancer. The project utilizes a set of mammogram images containing annotated breast tumor data. By applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other advanced deep learning techniques, the goal is to improve the model's accuracy and robustness in detecting breast tumors.

## Abstract
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection through automated systems can significantly improve survival rates. This project explores the use of deep learning models to detect and classify tumors in mammogram images. The dataset contains images labeled as benign or malignant, which are used to train and evaluate the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Key Features
- Dataset: The dataset consists of 3,383 mammogram images annotated with two categories: benign and malignant. These images are preprocessed for use in deep learning models.
- Model Architecture: The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features from mammogram images and classify them into benign or malignant categories.
- Data Preprocessing:
- Auto-orientation: EXIF orientation metadata is stripped to ensure correct image orientation.
- Resizing: Images are resized to 640x640 pixels to ensure consistency and compatibility with the model.
- Loss Function & Metrics: Binary cross-entropy loss is used, and the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric.
- Handling Class Imbalance: Techniques like weighted loss functions and data augmentation (e.g., rotations, flipping) are applied to manage class imbalance and improve model generalization.

## How This Helps?
This breast tumor detection system has several key applications:
- Early Cancer Detection: The model can assist in the early diagnosis of breast cancer, potentially saving lives by detecting malignant tumors in mammograms.
- Medical Imaging: The system can be used in medical imaging to automate and speed up the analysis of mammograms, reducing the workload of healthcare professionals.
- Research in Healthcare: The model can support research in the field of breast cancer detection, improving diagnostic tools and methods.

## Resources
Packages Used:

## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy: The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 85-90% on the test set, reflecting its ability to classify mammogram images into benign and malignant categories with reasonable success.
- Challenges: Despite using data augmentation and handling class imbalance, there is potential for further improvement in the model's performance.

## Confusion Matrix:
A confusion matrix can be used to evaluate the performance of the model, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
